const udiffFormattingRules = `# File editing rules:

Return edits in fenced \`\`\`udiff code blocks.

Make sure you include the first 2 lines with the file paths.
Don't include timestamps with the file paths.

--- path/to/old/file.py
+++ path/to/new/file.py

Start each hunk of changes with a \`@@ ... @@\` line.
Don't include line numbers like \`diff -U0\` does. The patch tool doesn't need them.

The patch tool needs CORRECT patches that apply cleanly against the current contents of the file!
Think carefully and make sure you include and mark all lines that need to be removed or changed as \`-\` lines.
Make sure you mark all new or modified lines with \`+\`.
Don't leave out any lines or the diff patch won't apply correctly.

Indentation matters in the diffs!

Start a new hunk for each section of the file that needs changes.

Only output hunks that specify changes with \`+\` or \`-\` lines.
Skip any hunks that are entirely unchanging \` \` lines.

When editing a function, method, loop, etc use a hunk to replace the *entire* code block.
Delete the entire existing version with \`-\` lines and then add a new, updated version with \`+\` lines.
This will help you generate correct code and correct diffs.

To make a new file, show a diff from \`--- /dev/null\` to \`+++ path/to/new/file.ext\`.

To delete a file, output a single line:
DELETE path/to/file.ext

To move or rename a file, output a single line:
MOVE path/from/old.ext TO path/to/new.ext
`;

const diffFencedFormattingRules = `# File editing rules:

Return edits in search/replace blocks. Each set of changes for a file must be in a fenced code block, preceded by a \`MODIFY\` command with the file path.

**To modify an existing file with one or more changes:**
MODIFY path/to/file.py
\`\`\`
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// original code to be replaced in the first location
=======
// new code to replace the original
>>>>>>> REPLACE
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// original code to be replaced in a second location
=======
// new code to replace it
>>>>>>> REPLACE
\`\`\`

**To create a new file:**
MODIFY path/to/new_file.ext
\`\`\`
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
// content of the new file
>>>>>>> REPLACE
\`\`\`

When using SEARCH/REPLACE, the SEARCH block must contain only the exact, original lines of code.

To delete a file, output a single line:
DELETE path/to/file.ext

To move or rename a file, output a single line:
MOVE path/from/old.ext TO path/to/new.ext
`;

const wholeFileFormattingRules = `# File editing rules:

For each file you need to modify, use a command (\`CREATE\` for new files, \`REWRITE\` for existing files) followed by the file path, and then the complete, updated content of the file within a fenced code block.

**To create a new file:**
CREATE path/to/new_file.py
\`\`\`python
// this file does not exist, it's just an example file to show you the response format
\`\`\`

**To modify an existing file:**
REWRITE path/to/existing_file.py
